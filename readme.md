# Flixxit

## Project Brief

Flixxit is a web application that aims to replicate the user experience and basic features of popular OTT platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, and AppleTV+. While the actual production-ready platforms are built with complex microservices and infrastructure, the objective of this project is to develop the core user functionality.

## Feature Set

The web-based application will provide the following features:

### User Accounts

- Visitors can sign up and log in using their email IDs and passwords for simplicity.

### User Profile

- Users have a profile that displays their account information, the content they have consumed, and suggestions based on their interests.
- Users can update their preferences.

### Dashboard

- Users can browse titles using horizontally scrollable carousels categorized by genres, categories, etc.

### Title View

- Clicking on a title will display the synopsis, rating, and other details of the chosen title.

### Search

- Users can search for various types of content such as web series, movies, short films, documentaries, etc.
- A third-party API like [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) can be used to obtain the data.

### Watchlist

- Users can add programs to their watchlist for later viewing.
- Autoplay feature for seamless content playback.

### Rating

- Users can rate programs with upvotes or downvotes, and the count is displayed.

### Video Player

- Users can preview or play selected content on the platform.
- "Skip Intro" feature to allow users to skip introductions in videos.
- The application will include a collection of videos that can be played on the video player.
- Multiple video quality options, such as HD and Auto.

### Payment and Subscription

- Users can subscribe to monthly or yearly plans to access all features of the application.
- Invoice display with a "Pay Now" button.
